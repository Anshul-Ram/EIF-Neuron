# EIF-Neuron (draft README)

This is a simulation of a neuron using the Exponential Integrate and Fire model, this is a differential equation which integrates the current incident to the axon of a neuron and spikes the voltage exponentially when a threshold voltage is exceeded.

I used this in my one dimensional spiking neuron model which spikes when enough current is incident to the axon, it then sends a voltage spike down the axon.

I did this as the project of my Maths Masters degree.

Here is a series of graphs from the simulation of the neuron:
